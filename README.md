A website for a local pizza place built using React. <br />
My goal is to become a Full-Stack Dev, so I am currently working on implementing Online Ordering to learn the basics. <br />
Live Demo: https://gregorispizza.netlify.app/ <br />
The site I chose to improve on: http://www.amandaspizza.net/
Also has a perfect lighthouse score ;)...... sometimes......
